  <p>Last updated: September 9, 2014</p>

<p>This User Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is a contract between you (&quot;you,&quot; &quot;your&quot; or &quot;user&quot;) and Coinbase, Inc., a Delaware Corporation with a principal office address of 548 Market Street, #23008, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA (&quot;Coinbase,&quot; &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and applies to your use of: (a) the Coinbase website located at coinbase.com, the Coinbase API, and any associated Coinbase-hosted websites or mobile applications (collectively the &quot;Coinbase Site&quot;), and (b) any of the services provided to you by Coinbase (together with the Coinbase Site, the &quot;Coinbase Services&quot;).</p>

<p>By signing up to use the Coinbase Account through the Coinbase Site, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by this Agreement. <strong>If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth in this Agreement, you may not access or use any of the Coinbase Services.</strong></p>

<p>We may amend or modify this Agreement by posting on the Coinbase Site or emailing to you the revised Agreement, and the revised Agreement shall be effective at such time, except where prior notice of the changes and modifications is required by law or on the instruction of a competent governmental agency. By continuing to access or use the Coinbase Services once the revised Agreement is effective, you agree to be bound by the Agreement. <strong>In the event that you do not agree to be bound by the modified Agreement, you must cancel your Coinbase Account in the manner described in Section 2.6 below and otherwise cease accessing or using the Coinbase Services.</strong> You will not be charged for terminating your relationship with Coinbase for this reason. You further agree that we may (a) modify or discontinue any portion of the Coinbase Services, and (b) suspend or terminate your access to the Coinbase Services, at any time, and from time to time, without notice to you in certain, limited circumstances described in Sections 2.6, 3.6.4, and 7.2. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or termination of the Coinbase Services, or suspension or termination of your access to the Coinbase Services, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein.</p>

<p>To be eligible to use the Coinbase Services, you must be at least 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority and contractual capacity if you reside in a jurisdiction where the age of majority or contractual capacity is above 18 years of age). By accessing or using the Coinbase Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.</p>

<p><strong>Please note the following risks of using Coinbase Services:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once submitted to the Bitcoin network, a Bitcoin Transaction (defined in Section 2.3 below) will be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one day or more) pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Bitcoin network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Bitcoin associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Coinbase Account balance or be available to conduct transactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The risk of loss in trading or holding bitcoin can be substantial.</strong> You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding bitcoin is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. <strong>In considering whether to trade or hold bitcoin, you should be aware that the price or value of bitcoin can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pursuant to Section 8.2 below, you agree that any disputes between you and Coinbase will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and you waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>1. Coinbase Services.</h2>

<p>Your Coinbase account (&quot;Coinbase Account&quot;) encompasses the following Coinbase Services:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>One or more hosted bitcoin accounts that allows users to store, track, transfer, and manage their bitcoin and account information and through which Coinbase can facilitate Bitcoin Transactions pursuant to instructions submitted by a user or authorized entity to Coinbase (the &quot;Coinbase Wallet&quot;);</p></li>
<li><p>A bitcoin exchange service through which users can buy bitcoin from, and sell bitcoin to, Coinbase (the &quot;Exchange Service&quot;); and</p></li>
<li><p>Users who intend to sell goods and/or services (each, a &quot;Merchant&quot;) and who wish to accept bitcoin from purchasers as a method of payment may use a suite of tools and related services for this purpose (the &quot;Merchant Services&quot;).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the Coinbase Account, Exchange Service and Merchant Services is described in detail below.</p>

<h2>2. Coinbase Account.</h2>

<p><strong>2.1. Registration of Coinbase Account.</strong> In order to use any of the Coinbase Services, you must first register by providing an e-mail address, password, and providing some identity information. Upon successful completion of the registration process, Coinbase will establish your Coinbase Account. Coinbase may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish a Coinbase Account, or limit the number of Coinbase Accounts that a single user may establish and maintain at any time.</p>

<p><strong>2.2. Identity Verification.</strong> In order to use certain features of the Coinbase Services, including certain transfers of bitcoin and/or currency, you may be required to provide Coinbase with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number). Coinbase may also require you to answer certain questions or take actions in order to verify your identity, provide the Coinbase Services to you, or comply with applicable law. In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update Coinbase if any information changes. <strong>You hereby authorize Coinbase to, directly or through third parties, (i) make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or account information, and (ii) request and obtain any consumer report, credit report or similar information relating to you and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports, and hereby authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.</strong></p>

<h3>2.3. Bitcoin Transactions.</h3>

<p><strong>2.3.1.</strong> As part of the services offered in connection with your Coinbase Account, Coinbase can help you send bitcoin to, and request and receive bitcoin from, third parties pursuant to instructions you provide through the Coinbase Site (each such transaction is a &quot;Bitcoin Transaction&quot;). You may initiate a Bitcoin Transaction by going to the Coinbase Site, choosing to send or request, and entering the requisite information regarding the sender or recipient and the amount of bitcoin to be transferred. Coinbase will then communicate with the Bitcoin network on your behalf, as necessary, to facilitate each Bitcoin Transaction in accordance with these instructions.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.2. Coinbase reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Bitcoin Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order. Coinbase cannot reverse a Bitcoin Transaction which has been communicated to and confirmed by the Bitcoin network.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.3.3.</strong> Coinbase has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party. Coinbase is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with bitcoin transferred using the Coinbase Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must handle it directly with that third party. Due to the nature of bitcoin, any Bitcoin Transaction conducted using the Coinbase Services is final regardless of any defects in or non-delivery of any goods or services purchased in connection with such Bitcoin Transaction, or any other aspect of your transaction or relationship with the relevant third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Coinbase Support at <a href="https://support.coinbase.com/">https://support.coinbase.com</a> so that we may consider whether to take any action.</p>

<p>In the event that you conduct a Bitcoin Transaction for purposes of paying a Merchant (defined herein) for goods or services and that Merchant uses Coinbase Services to provide you with a refund, such refund may be effected via a separate Bitcoin Transaction having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in local currency (e.g., U.S. dollars), based on the then current Conversion Rate. As a result, you may receive less bitcoin than you initially used to pay the Merchant. For information concerning the Conversion Rate, see Section 3 herein.</p>

<p>Coinbase processes Bitcoin Transactions according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to Coinbase as the relevant Bitcoin Transaction may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated.</p>

<p>If you initiate a Bitcoin Transaction by entering the recipient&#39;s bitcoin address, Coinbase will confirm that the bitcoin address is valid; however, Coinbase cannot confirm that the bitcoin address belongs to the intended recipient. In the event you initiate a Bitcoin Transaction by entering the recipient&#39;s email address and the recipient does not have an existing Coinbase Account, Coinbase will email the recipient and invite them to open a Coinbase Account. If the designated recipient does not open a Coinbase Account within 30 days, Coinbase will return the bitcoin associated with the transaction to your Coinbase Account.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.4. Taxes.</strong> It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions associated with your receipt or transfer of bitcoin, and/or to the Bitcoin Transactions you conduct through the Coinbase Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is available through your Coinbase Account.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.5. Limits.</strong> Coinbase reserves the right to change the buy/sell, transfer, storage and velocity limits applicable to your Coinbase Account, including, but not limited to, the Exchange Service transaction limits described in Section 3.4 below, in our sole discretion.</p>

<p><strong>2.4 Bitcoin Storage &amp; Transmission Delays.</strong> Coinbase securely stores 100% of all bitcoin associated with your Coinbase Account in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for Coinbase to retrieve this information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Bitcoin Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Bitcoin Transaction for 48 hours or more. As a user of the Coinbase Services, you accept the risk that a Bitcoin Transaction facilitated by Coinbase may be delayed and you agree not to hold Coinbase responsible for any damages or injury arising out of or related to such delay. See Section 9 – General Provisions, for a further description of our limited liability.</p>

<p><strong>2.5. Third-Party Applications.</strong> If, to the extent permitted by Coinbase from time to time, you grant express permission to a third party to access or connect to your Coinbase Account, either through the third party&#39;s product or service or through the Coinbase Site, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement. You are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any third party using your Coinbase Account credentials. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold Coinbase responsible for, and will indemnify Coinbase from, any liability arising out of or related to any act or omission of any third party using your Coinbase Account credentials. You may change or remove permissions granted by you to third parties with respect to your Coinbase Account at any time through the Account Settings (Integrations) page on the Coinbase Site.</p>

<p><strong>2.6. Suspension/Termination and Coinbase Account Cancellation.</strong> Coinbase may: (a) suspend or terminate your access to any or all of the Coinbase Services, and (b) deactivate or cancel your Coinbase Account as required by a valid subpoena or court order, or if Coinbase reasonably suspects you of using your Coinbase Account in furtherance of illegal activity, or if you take any action that Coinbase deems as circumventing Coinbase&#39;s controls, including, but not limited to, opening multiple Coinbase Accounts or abusing promotions which Coinbase may offer from time to time. You will be permitted to transfer bitcoin associated with your Coinbase Wallet for ninety (90) days after Account deactivation or cancelation unless such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, or (ii) by a valid subpoena or court order.  Merchant users are subject to additional cancellation policies set forth in Section 4.7. You may cancel your Coinbase Account at any time by transferring or exchanging all bitcoin associated with your Coinbase Wallet and visiting <a href="../signin.html">https://www.coinbase.com/settings/cancel</a>. You will not be charged for canceling your Coinbase Account and will only be required to pay for those Coinbase Services used that are subject to charges. If any transaction is in a pending state at the time your Coinbase Account is cancelled or suspended, such transaction may be cancelled and/or refunded as appropriate. You may not cancel your Coinbase Account to evade an investigation or avoid paying any amounts otherwise due to Coinbase. Upon cancellation of your Coinbase Account, you authorize Coinbase to cancel or suspend pending Exchange Service transactions and hold the funds associated with such transactions until Coinbase is certain that funding reversal windows are complete. In the event that you or Coinbase terminates this Agreement or your access to the Coinbase Services, or deactivates or cancels your Coinbase Account, you will remain liable for all amounts due hereunder. In the event that a technical problem causes system outage or Account errors, Coinbase may temporarily suspend access to your Account until the problem is resolved.</p>

<p><strong>2.7. Legal Compliance.</strong> Pursuant to the economic sanctions programs administered in the countries where Coinbase conducts business, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Treasury&#39;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&quot;OFAC&quot;), Coinbase is prohibited from providing services or entering into relationships with certain individuals and entities. In the event that Coinbase is required to block assets associated with your Coinbase Account in accordance with a sanctions program, or other similar government sanctions programs, Coinbase may (i) deactivate or cancel your Coinbase Wallet or block user activity, (ii) transfer bitcoin from your Coinbase Wallet to an originating source or to an account specified by authorities, or (iii) require you to transfer your bitcoin out of your Coinbase Wallet within a certain period of time. <strong>Coinbase is not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our complying with applicable law, the guidance or direction of any regulatory authority or government agency, or any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant or other legal order.</strong></p>

<h2>3. The Exchange Service.</h2>

<p><strong>3.1. Transactions with Coinbase.</strong> When buying or selling bitcoin through the Exchange Service, you are buying from, or selling to, Coinbase directly. Coinbase does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin. The Exchange Service is subject to the Coinbase &quot;Conversion Rate.&quot; &quot;Conversion Rate&quot; means the liquidity adjusted price of a given bitcoin amount in terms of local currency as quoted on the Coinbase Site. The Conversion Rate is stated either as a &quot;Buy Price,&quot; the price in terms of local currency at which you purchase bitcoin from Coinbase, or as a &quot;Sell Price,&quot; the price in terms of local currency at which you sell bitcoin to Coinbase. For the purpose of any transaction which incorporates the Conversion Rate, you agree, as a condition of using any Coinbase Services, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric.</p>

<p><strong>3.2. Bitcoin Purchases.</strong> After successfully completing the verification steps described in the <a href="verifications.html">Verification Procedures</a>, which are incorporated herein by reference, you may purchase bitcoin from Coinbase, subject to the above-referenced daily limits. Coinbase will instruct its bank to initiate a debit to your primary payment method or, if the payment is not successful, to any payment method you have on file, in an amount equal to: (a) the total number of bitcoin you wish to purchase multiplied by the Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the Coinbase Site at the time that you initiate the transaction, plus (b) the applicable Exchange Fee (defined below), plus (c) additional fees as may apply in the event that Coinbase cannot draw funds from your payment method and must charge a backup payment method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, Coinbase will provide a date by which your bitcoin will be made available in your Coinbase Wallet, which may depend on the time required for Coinbase to receive funds from your payment method. If your bitcoin purchase is marked as complete or pending in your Coinbase Wallet, such transaction cannot be cancelled, reversed or changed. In connection with any purchase of bitcoin from Coinbase, Coinbase will use good faith efforts to fulfill such purchase order at the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the Coinbase Site at the time that you place such order. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for Coinbase to delay fulfillment of a purchase order until such time as we are able to execute the transaction. In such cases, we will notify you through the Coinbase Site prior to the completion of your purchase order that the amount of bitcoin that you will receive will be determined based on the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the Coinbase Site at the time Coinbase executes your transaction, not the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the Coinbase Site at the time you authorized such purchase.</p>

<p><strong>3.3. Sale Transactions.</strong> After successfully completing the verification steps described in the <a href="verifications.html">Verification Procedures</a>, you may sell bitcoin to Coinbase, subject to the above-referenced daily limits, by instructing Coinbase accordingly. Coinbase will then instruct its bank to initiate a credit to your linked payout method, in an amount equal to: (a) the total number of bitcoin you wish to sell multiplied by the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted on the Coinbase Site at the time that you initiate the transaction, minus (b) the applicable Exchange Fee (defined below). Coinbase will then initiate a transfer of the appropriate amount of bitcoin from your Coinbase Wallet to Coinbase&#39;s own bitcoin wallet, and the related proceeds of funds will thereafter be credited to your linked payout method. The proceeds of any bitcoin sale will be credited to your linked payout method or Currency Account within two to three business days. Upon any sale of bitcoin to Coinbase, all settlements or payments by Coinbase for such transaction shall be paid in local currency (e.g., USD) at the applicable Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted on the Coinbase Site at the time that you approved the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>3.4. Limits.</strong> Coinbase imposes limits on the number of bitcoin that you may buy or sell in a given day, as published in the <a href="verifications.html">Verification Procedures</a>. Coinbase reserves the right to change the amount of bitcoin that you may buy from, or sell to, Coinbase as we deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. Coinbase does not guarantee the availability of its Exchange Service, and the act of purchasing bitcoin from Coinbase does not result in a guarantee that you may sell your bitcoin to Coinbase.</p>

<p><strong>3.5. Exchange Fee.</strong> Each Exchange Service transaction is subject to a fee (the &quot;Exchange Fee&quot;) charged by Coinbase which consists of: (a) a conversion fee for the exchange of local currency (e.g., USD) for bitcoin (or vice versa) which is calculated as a percentage of the local currency to be exchanged, plus (b) a fixed transfer fee which may be applied to cover applicable bank fees. The current Exchange Fee is displayed on the Coinbase Site prior to you completing an Exchange Service transaction. Your bank may charge you a non-sufficient funds (&quot;NSF&quot;) fee or overdraft fee in the event that you do not have sufficient funds to complete a transaction.</p>

<h3>3.6. Payments.</h3>

<p><strong>3.6.1.</strong> You agree to deliver payment for any bitcoin purchase made through the Exchange Service upon confirmation of an order, regardless of changes in the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate prior to completion of the purchase transaction, with such payment to be made in good funds in the amount calculated in the manner specified herein.</p>

<p><strong>3.6.2.</strong> If there are insufficient funds from your linked primary payment method to cover the purchase price of any bitcoin order or any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder, you hereby authorize us to debit any of your payment methods which have been linked to your Coinbase Account for the full or partial amount of your purchase and any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder. We may resubmit debits or charges to your payment methods until all amounts owed by you to us hereunder are satisfied in full. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance in each of your accounts and sufficient credit limits on your credit cards in order to avoid any overdraft, NSF or similar fees. To secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement, you grant to Coinbase a security interest in any and all of your funds or other property which come into the possession of Coinbase and the bitcoin associated with your Coinbase Account. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.</p>

<p><strong>3.6.3.</strong> We may deduct any bitcoin held by you in a Coinbase Wallet if a payment for a purchase of bitcoin using a bank account or credit card is subsequently reversed, for example, if such a payment is subject to a chargeback, reversal, claim or is otherwise invalidated. We may also deduct bitcoin held by you in a Coinbase Wallet in satisfaction of any outstanding amount owed by you to Coinbase under this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>3.6.4.</strong> <strong>Coinbase reserves the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any purchases or sales of bitcoin in its sole discretion, including but not limited to instances where Coinbase suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime, in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if Coinbase suspects the transaction relates to a Restricted Activity as defined in Section 7.2 or the <a href="prohibited.html">Prohibited Businesses</a> list, which list is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.7.</strong> You do not have a statutory right to withdraw from a transaction to buy or sell bitcoin once you have instructed Coinbase because the price of bitcoin fluctuates in accordance with the financial market for bitcoin, which is outside the control of Coinbase.</p>

<h2>4. Additional Terms for Merchants.</h2>

<p><strong>4.1. Merchant Services.</strong> Through the Merchant Services, Coinbase enables Merchants to accept bitcoin from customers as a method of payment, and processes the transfer of bitcoin to Merchants from their customers.  Merchants may also sell bitcoin to, or buy bitcoin from, Coinbase, and otherwise utilize the Coinbase Services, in the same manner as any other user. In addition to the other terms set forth in this Agreement, including identity verification as set forth in Section 2.2, Merchants who utilize the Merchant Services are subject to this Section 4.</p>

<p><strong>4.2. Transaction Confirmation.</strong> Once Coinbase successfully processes a payment credit to a Merchant using the Coinbase Services, a confirmation will be sent to the Merchant. Newly-boarded Merchants may be required to submit to additional verification procedures as necessary to verify that the Merchant operates a legitimate business. Steps involved in such verification shall include, but not be limited to, providing the Merchant company’s legal name, logo, website, phone number, address, taxpayer identification number, and a designation of whether the merchant has a retail location or online presence only, a designation of business type, and a designation of business category. Until completion of such verification procedures, newly-boarded Merchants may experience delayed processing of Bitcoin Transactions or Exchange Service transactions. Coinbase will designate any such delayed transaction as &quot;pending,&quot; and funds will not be available in the Merchant&#39;s Coinbase Account and/or Currency Account until the pending transaction is completed. Coinbase reserves the right to refuse to process, cancel, or to reverse any Merchant transaction (i) as required by law, (ii) in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or (iii) if Coinbase reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous, or related to Restricted Activity as defined in section 7.2.</p>

<p><strong>4.3. Instant Exchange.</strong> Coinbase may offer its optional Instant Exchange Service to Merchants who have successfully linked a payout method to their Coinbase Account. The Instant Exchange Service will allow Merchants to designate the price of their goods and services in local currency (e.g., USD) and customers to pay for their purchases from such Merchant in bitcoin based on the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted by Coinbase on the Coinbase Site and displayed to the customer at the time that the customer approves the purchase. In connection with the Instant Exchange Service, the Merchant, as merchant of record for each transaction, shall: (i) accept bitcoin into their corresponding Coinbase Wallet; (ii) immediately sell such bitcoin to Coinbase using the Instant Exchange Service, and (iii) subsequently receive the proceeds from such bitcoin sale transaction from Coinbase in the relevant local currency. By using this service, each Merchant agrees that regardless of any change in the price of bitcoin between the time of purchase and settlement, the Merchant will receive the fixed purchase price as designated by the Merchant in local currency at the time the customer approved the purchase.</p>

<p><strong>4.4. Settlement.</strong> Settlements to Merchant in connection with the Merchant&#39;s sale of bitcoin to Coinbase will generally take a minimum of two to three business days, following Coinbase&#39;s transmission to Merchant of confirmation of the relevant transaction, although exceptions may apply.</p>

<p><strong>4.5. Merchant Transactions.</strong> Each Merchant acknowledges and agrees that Coinbase has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that the Merchant may sell to customers using the Coinbase Services. Each Merchant is responsible for handling customer inquiries related to the goods and/or services it sells to customers through the Coinbase Services, except for inquiries related to payment for such goods or services which will be handled by Coinbase. Each Merchant warrants that it will not use any Coinbase Services in connection with any Restricted Activities, as described herein. Each Merchant confirms that by opening a Coinbase Account, the Merchant will not use the Coinbase Services to accept payments in connection with any of the <a href="prohibited.html">Prohibited Businesses</a>. Each Merchant further warrants that it will not use Coinbase Services in connection with transactions which involve pre-payment of an order which the Merchant does not intend to fulfill within thirty (30) days. When a Merchant must issue a refund to a customer, Coinbase will debit the Merchant&#39;s Coinbase Wallet for the relevant number of bitcoin (or, in the event the Merchant uses the Instant Exchange service, the Merchant shall purchase the relevant amount of bitcoin in local currency before bitcoin are debited from the Merchant&#39;s Coinbase Wallet) and provide a refund to the customer in bitcoin having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in local currency (e.g., USD), based on the then current Conversion Rate.</p>

<p><strong>4.6. Obligations of Merchants:</strong> In addition to the obligations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Merchants shall:</p>

<p>(a) At all times maintain all licenses, registrations, authorizations and approvals required to operate their business, conduct all activities related thereto, and utilize the Coinbase Services in connection therewith.</p>

<p>(b) Ensure that all aspects of their business, including (i) all Merchant activities, and the activity of any third party engaged by the Merchant, (ii) the goods and serviced offered for sale by Merchant, and (iii) the acts or omissions of each Merchant in connection with their use of Coinbase Services comply with applicable law at all times.</p>

<p>(c) Promptly provide, and cause third parties under its control to promptly provide, such information as Coinbase may request from time to time regarding (i) the Merchant, its policies, procedures, and activities, (ii) any good or service offered for sale and for which the Merchant may accept payment by use of Coinbase Services, or (iii) any transaction conducted through the use of Coinbase Services, to the extent Coinbase deems such information reasonably necessary to comply with its policies or procedures, applicable law, an audit, or the guidance or direction of, or request from, any regulatory authority or financial institution.</p>

<p>(d) Within the Coinbase-hosted payment page, accurately identity the sale item in the Item Name field and provide an accurate and succinct description of the same sale item in the Item Description Field.</p>

<p><strong>4.7 Merchant Account Cancellation:</strong> If, in Coinbase&#39;s discretion, a Merchant is understood to take any action that Coinbase deems as circumventing Coinbase&#39;s controls, including, but not limited to, opening multiple Coinbase Accounts or abusing promotions which Coinbase may offer from time to time, Coinbase may cancel or suspend corresponding Merchant Account(s). Coinbase Merchant Account(s) may also be suspended or cancelled according to the procedure set forth in Section 2.6 (i) as required by law, (ii) in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order, (iii) if the Merchant engages in any Restricted Activity as defined in Section 7.2, or (iv) if Coinbase determines that your Account activity presents a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance.</p>

<p><strong>4.8. Indemnification.</strong> The Merchant agrees to indemnify and hold Coinbase, its affiliates, and Service Providers, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees, and representatives, harmless from any claim or demand (including attorneys&#39; fees and any fines, fees, or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to (i) the Merchant’s breach of this Agreement, (ii) the Merchant’s use of Coinbase Services, or (iii) the Merchant’s violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>

<p><strong>4.9. Merchant Governing Law.</strong> Notwithstanding Section 9.10: This Agreement between the Merchant and Coinbase will be governed by the law of the State of California except to the extent governed by U.S. federal law.</p>

<p><strong>4.10. English Language Controls</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any translation of this Agreement is provided for the Merchant’s convenience.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. THE LIABILITY OF COINBASE, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF (A) THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DIRECT DAMAGES; OR (B) FEES PAID TO COINBASE BY YOU IN THE PRECEDING THREE (3) MONTHS.</p>

THIS PARAGRAPH GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</p>
